## 2025-01-04 - Major Data Organization Cleanup & Pipeline Setup

### 🎯 **Session Goal**
Set up South Holland urban embedding pipeline with FSI threshold 0.1 using AlphaEarth aerial embeddings, along with roadnetwork, POI, and GTFS data.

### ❌ **Initial Problems Identified**
- Data scattered across multiple locations (`cache/`, `scripts/preprocessing/data/`, `data/skeleton/`)
- Incorrect embedding file paths in pipeline
- Missing accessibility graphs for walk mode (resolution 10)
- No FSI threshold preprocessing capability
- Inconsistent data structure organization

### ✅ **Major Accomplishments**

#### 1. **Complete Data Organization Restructure**
- **Before**: Data scattered across cache/, scripts/preprocessing/data/, data/skeleton/
- **After**: Clean hierarchy under data/ with study areas as main structuring element
- **Actions**:
  - Moved accessibility graphs: `cache/networks/accessibility/` → `data/networks/accessibility/`
  - Moved OSM networks: `cache/networks/osm/` → `data/networks/osm/`
  - Removed duplicate `scripts/preprocessing/data/` folder
  - Eliminated `data/skeleton/` structure
  - Created preprocessed structure with study areas as primary organization

#### 2. **FSI Threshold Processing Implementation**
- **Created**: `create_fsi01_variant.py` - Custom FSI filtering script
- **Generated**: `south_holland_fsi01` variant with FSI ≥ 0.1 filtering
- **Results**:
  - Resolution 8: 5,548 → 1,797 regions (32.4% kept, mean FSI: 0.446)
  - Resolution 9: 37,818 → 11,055 regions (29.2% kept, mean FSI: 0.506)  
  - Resolution 10: 261,894 → 70,903 regions (27.1% kept, mean FSI: 0.544)
- **Impact**: Focused dataset on urban areas with meaningful building density

#### 3. **Pipeline Architecture Updates**
- **Fixed**: Embedding file paths to use correct AlphaEarth data
  - Updated from finetune to raw AlphaEarth: `embeddings_aerial_10_alphaearth.parquet`
  - Corrected all modality paths with proper subdirectories
- **Removed**: Deprecated `ThresholdPreprocessor` dependency
- **Enhanced**: `SpatialGraphConstructor` with clean data structure support
- **Added**: `data_dir` parameter for organized graph/network loading

#### 4. **Multi-Resolution Data Validation**
- **Verified**: H3 hierarchical mapping between resolutions 8, 9, 10
- **Confirmed**: Building density (FSI_24) data properly joined across all resolutions
- **Tested**: Geographic data loading with proper CRS handling
- **Validated**: Cross-scale feature mapping functionality

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

#### Key Files Created/Modified
- `create_fsi01_variant.py` - FSI threshold filtering (✅ Complete)
- `create_base_south_holland.py` - Base dataset preparation (✅ Complete)
- `generate_walk_accessibility.py` - Walk accessibility graph generation (⏳ In Progress)
- `test_clean_pipeline.py` - Pipeline validation script (✅ Ready)
- `urban_embedding/pipeline.py` - Updated paths, removed deprecated dependencies
- `urban_embedding/graph_construction.py` - Enhanced with clean data structure support

#### Configuration Updates
- **FSI Configuration**: Added support for decimal thresholds (0.1) vs percentage (50%)
- **Embedding Paths**: Updated to use organized subdirectory structure
- **Graph Loading**: Enhanced to use `data/networks/` instead of `cache/networks/`
- **Directory Management**: Study area as primary organizational element

### ⏳ **Work in Progress**
- **Walk Accessibility Graph**: Generation started for 261,894 regions (large computational task)
- **File**: `generate_walk_accessibility.py` ready to complete
- **Estimate**: 30-60 minutes on GPU
