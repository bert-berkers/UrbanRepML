# Data Directory

This directory contains all the data used and generated by the `UrbanRepML` library and its associated experiments.

## Directory Structure

The data is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **`boundaries/`**: Contains geospatial boundary files, primarily for defining study areas. For example, the `cascadia/` subdirectory contains the GeoJSON files that define the counties and states of the Cascadia bioregion.

- **`embeddings/`**: Stores the pre-computed, multi-modal embeddings that serve as the input features for the `UrbanRepML` model. Each modality (e.g., `aerial_alphaearth`, `gtfs`, `poi_hex2vec`) has its own subdirectory.

- **`temporal/`**: Contains data related to temporal analysis, such as the gap analysis reports for the Cascadia experiment's multi-year data.

## Experiment-Specific Data

Note that while this directory contains the base input data, data that is generated *by* an experiment is typically stored within that experiment's own directory in `experiments/`.

For example, the intermediate and final H3-aggregated Parquet files for the Cascadia experiment are stored in `experiments/cascadia_exploratory/data/`. This keeps the outputs of each experiment self-contained.

## Data Sources

The data in this repository comes from a variety of sources, including:
- **AlphaEarth**: For high-resolution satellite imagery embeddings.
- **OpenStreetMap**: For road networks and building footprints.
- **Public Transit Feeds (GTFS)**: For public transportation network data.
- **Hex2Vec**: For Points of Interest (POI) embeddings.

Please refer to the `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `README.md` file for each experiment for more specific details on how this data is used.
