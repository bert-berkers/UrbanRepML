# Roads Modality

**Road Network Topology Embeddings**

## Status: Not Yet Implemented

This modality will process road network data into H3 hexagon-based graph embeddings representing connectivity and accessibility patterns.

## Planned Features
- OSM road network extraction
- Graph topology analysis
- Centrality metrics (betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
- Road classification embeddings
- Network density and connectivity

## Expected Interface
```python
from modalities import load_modality_processor

processor = load_modality_processor('roads', {
    'network_types': ['drive', 'bike', 'walk'],
    'graph_metrics': ['centrality', 'clustering', 'connectivity'],
    'edge_weights': 'travel_time'
})

embeddings = processor.run_pipeline(
    study_area='cascadia',
    h3_resolution=8,
    output_dir='data/processed/embeddings/roads'
)
```

## Data Sources
- OpenStreetMap road networks
- Municipal street datasets
- Traffic flow data (when available)
