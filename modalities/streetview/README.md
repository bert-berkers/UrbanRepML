# StreetView Modality

**Street-Level Imagery Embeddings**

## Status: Not Yet Implemented

This modality will process street-level imagery into H3 hexagon-based visual feature embeddings.

## Planned Features
- Street-level image collection (Google Street View, Mapillary)
- Deep learning visual feature extraction
- Urban scene understanding (greenery, building types, walkability)
- Temporal change detection
- Aesthetic and environmental quality metrics

## Example Usage (Hypothetical)
```python
from modalities.streetview import StreetViewProcessor  # This processor is not yet implemented
import geopandas as gpd

# Define a study area
study_area_gdf = gpd.read_file("path/to/your/study_area.geojson")

# Configuration for the processor
config = {
    'output_dir': 'data/processed/embeddings/streetview',
    'image_source': 'mapillary',
    'feature_model': 'dinov3_large',
    'images_per_hexagon': 16,
}

# Initialize and run the processor
# processor = StreetViewProcessor(config)
# embeddings_path = processor.run_pipeline(
#     study_area=study_area_gdf,
#     h3_resolution=10
# )

# print(f"StreetView embeddings saved to: {embeddings_path}")
```
