<!--
  CHANGED 2026-04-19 (Terminal D willowy-leaning-maple, audit-trail cleanup):
  Removed `context: fork` (and the now-superfluous `user-invocable` /
  `disable-model-invocation` lines) so /valuate executes inline in the
  coordinator's main context, exactly like /niche does. The forking
  variant ran the skill in a fresh subprocess whose PID-walk could not
  reliably resolve the real terminal — that subprocess then wrote
  identity-bearing files (terminal yaml + supra yaml) under a freshly
  generated session_id, colliding with the real Terminal B and breaking
  the SessionStart-hook identity. See
  `.claude/scratchpad/coordinator/notes.md` §"2026-04-19 — Failure Mode:
  Identity Tagging Drift" for full root-cause + lessons. The user's
  guidance on the fix: "valuate shouldn't run as subagent... it's just
  the main terminal like niche."

## Task

You are operating on the **static liveability graph** (see `deepresearch/liveability_approaches_graph.json`, key `"static"`).

A **shard** is a terminal — one PPID, one `/valuate` → `/niche` pipeline, one full vertical column through the three-layer graph:
- **Indicators**: the files, code paths, and data this terminal works with
- **Percepts**: the agents (context windows) this terminal spawns
- **Needs/desires**: the intent and characteristic states set here in `/valuate`

Indicators feed forward one-way into percepts (`→`); percepts and needs/desires mutually assess (`↔`). When multiple terminals run concurrently, each is its own shard. Cross-shard coupling happens at two levels:
- **Needs/desires** (static, `/valuate`): the valuate scratchpad + coordinator path claims (constraints on indicators, set at this level)
- **Percepts** (dynamic, `/niche`): `/sync` lateral coupling between agent context windows

The human negotiates between shards to form rational preferences — this is where intent gets set, and everything `/niche` does downstream is directed by it.

$ARGUMENTS

## Protocol

### Step 0: Set Graph Mode

Set the active graph to "static" using `supra_reader.set_active_graph("static")`. This disables lateral percept coupling (`/sync`) — during valuation, coupling is between shards (needs/desires), not between percepts.

### Step 1: Read Current State

Read this terminal's identity via `coordinator_registry.read_ppid_identity()` (terminal-PID-keyed, multi-terminal safe; one identity per terminal, persists across `/clear`). Then read states:
1. Try `.claude/supra/sessions/{identity_id}.yaml` (terminal-scoped, takes priority)
2. Fall back to hardcoded neutral defaults (all dimensions = 3)
3. Read `.claude/supra/schema.yaml` for dimension definitions, groups, mode biases, agent relevance
4. Determine current temporal segment from local time (e.g., `friday-evening`) using `supra_reader._temporal_segment_key()`
5. Look up that segment in `supra/temporal_priors.yaml` using `supra_reader.get_temporal_prior()`
6. If it exists and has sufficient observations, it becomes the "suggested prior" — available for the morning inread and as a shorthand option

There is no global state file. Defaults are hardcoded neutral 3s. Your attunement writes session-scoped only, so parallel sessions with different goals don't overwrite each other.

### Step 2: Show Current Landscape

Print a compact summary. Use this exact layout:

```
Current attentional landscape:
Mode: {mode} | Speed: {execution_speed} | Explore: {exploration_vs_exploitation} | Quality: {code_quality} | Tests: {test_coverage} | Spatial: {spatial_correctness} | Model: {model_architecture}
Focus: {focus list or "(none)"} | Suppress: {suppress list or "(none)"}
Last attuned: {timestamp or "never"}
```

If there are dimensions beyond the six core ones (added via recommendations), append them to the second line.

### Step 3: Check for Shorthand Arguments

If the user passed arguments (via `$ARGUMENTS`), parse them as shorthand and **skip the questionnaire**. Shorthand mappings:

| Shorthand | Dimension |
|-----------|-----------|
| `speed` | `execution_speed` |
| `explore` | `exploration_vs_exploitation` |
| `quality` | `code_quality` |
| `tests` | `test_coverage` |
| `spatial` | `spatial_correctness` |
| `model` | `model_architecture` |

Additional shorthand syntax:
- Mode names recognized directly: `exploratory`, `focused`, `sprint`, `creative`
- **Compound state names** recognized directly: `creative-prototyping`, `production-hardening`, `deep-investigation`, `sprint-shipping`, `careful-exploration`, `training-run`
  - A compound state sets specific dimensions to absolute values and optionally sets the mode
  - Compound state dimensions are defined in `schema.yaml` under `compound_states:`
  - Dimensions NOT specified by the compound state are left at their current values
  - Any explicit dimension overrides in the same command take precedence over the compound state's values
  - Example: `/valuate deep-investigation, speed 2` applies deep-investigation then overrides execution_speed to 2
- `focus "..."` sets the focus directive (replaces existing focus list with single item)
- `suppress "..."` sets the suppress directive (replaces existing suppress list with single item)
- Bare dimension names without a value are treated as amplify (set to 4)
- Values are integers 1-5
- `save:name` saves current state as a named profile (after applying any other changes in the same command)
- `load:name` loads a saved profile, replacing mode, dimensions, focus, and suppress
- `profiles` or `list` lists all saved profiles
- **`use prior`**: Loads the temporal prior's rounded values as the starting state. Equivalent to setting each dimension to the temporal prior's rounded value and mode to the prior's majority-vote mode. If no temporal prior exists for the current segment, prints a warning and falls through to the questionnaire.

**Profile operations:**
- Profiles are stored in `.claude/supra/profiles/{name}.yaml`
- `save:` runs AFTER other shorthand changes, so `/valuate sprint, save:sprint-default` first applies sprint mode, then saves the result
- `load:` runs BEFORE other shorthand changes, so `/valuate load:training, speed 5` loads the training profile then overrides speed
- Use `supra_reader.save_profile()`, `supra_reader.load_profile()`, and `supra_reader.list_profiles()` from `.claude/hooks/supra_reader.py`

**Examples:**
- `/valuate speed 5, tests 1` -- sets execution_speed=5, test_coverage=1
- `/valuate sprint` -- sets mode to sprint
- `/valuate focused, model 5, focus "prove hex2vec works"` -- mode=focused, model_architecture=5, focus set
- `/valuate explore` -- ambiguous: could mean mode=exploratory or exploration_vs_exploitation=4. Resolve: if no number follows, check if it matches a mode name first. `explore` is not a mode name, so it maps to the dimension at value 4. `exploratory` IS a mode name.

**Resolution order for bare names** (no number follows):
1. Check compound state names first (e.g., `creative-prototyping` -- hyphenated names are always compound states)
2. Check mode names (`exploratory`, `focused`, `sprint`, `creative`)
3. Check dimension shorthands (`speed`, `explore`, `quality`, `tests`, `spatial`, `model`)
4. Check profile operations (`profiles`, `list`, `save:`, `load:`)
5. Check temporal prior shortcuts (`use prior`, `prior`)
- `/valuate save:creative-evening` -- saves current state as "creative-evening"
- `/valuate load:training` -- restores the "training" profile
- `/valuate sprint, speed 5, tests 1, save:ship-it` -- applies sprint + overrides, saves as "ship-it"
- `/valuate profiles` -- lists all saved profiles
- `/valuate creative-prototyping` -- applies the creative-prototyping compound state (sets explore=5, speed=4, quality=2, tests=1, mode=creative)
- `/valuate deep-investigation, focus "understand hex2vec loss landscape"` -- applies compound state + sets focus
- `/valuate training-run, speed 4` -- applies training-run then overrides execution_speed to 4
- `/valuate use prior` -- loads the learned temporal prior for the current time segment
- `/valuate use prior, speed 5` -- loads temporal prior then overrides execution_speed to 5

If shorthand is provided, apply changes and jump to Step 6 (print summary). Do not ask questions.

### Step 3.5: Morning Inread (when no shorthand AND session appears to be first of the day)

If all of these are true: (a) no shorthand was provided, (b) `last_attuned` is from a previous day or null, and (c) a saved profile exists — this is likely the human's first session of the day. Before jumping to the questionnaire, offer a **morning inread**: a curated reading list to orient the human with their cup of tea.

**Build the reading list** by scanning for the most informative files from the previous session(s):

1. **Valuate scratchpads from other shards** (highest priority for multi-terminal): `.claude/scratchpad/valuate/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — each entry is keyed by terminal identity (one identity per terminal), showing what other shards valued today and what intent they set. This is how you avoid duplicating work or setting conflicting intents.
2. **Coordinator forward-look**: `.claude/scratchpad/coordinator/YYYY-MM-DD-forward-look.md` from the most recent date. This is written specifically to seed the next session.
3. **Ego assessment**: `.claude/scratchpad/ego/YYYY-MM-DD.md` from the most recent date. Process health, attention needed, metrics table.
4. **Recent git log**: `git log --oneline -10` — what actually shipped.
5. **Active coordinator messages**: any unread messages in `.claude/coordinators/messages/{date}/` from after last attunement.
6. **Any specialist scratchpads newer than last attunement** — only mention these by name and one-line summary, don't dump content.

**Present the inread** as a compact recommendation:

```
Good morning. Here's your inread before we valuate:

📖 Reading list:
  1. Coordinator forward-look (2026-03-08) — tomorrow's plan, LR schedule fix P0
  2. Ego assessment (2026-03-08) — 4/5 process health, checkpoint versioning P0
  3. git log: 2 commits since last session (rename + liveability graph)
  4. No unread coordinator messages.

Temporal prior for friday-evening (4 observations):
  Mode: focused | Speed: 3.7→4 | Explore: 3.2→3 | Quality: 3.1→3 |
  Tests: 2.3→2 | Spatial: 2.8→3 | Model: 4.6→5
  (Your Friday evenings tend toward focused mode with high model attention)

Manual profile also available: "friday-evening" (saved 2026-03-13)

Take your time reading. When you're ready, I'll ask 4 quick questions — or:
  "use prior" — start from the learned temporal prior
  "load friday-evening" — restore the manual profile snapshot
```

**Key principles:**
- This is a PAUSE, not a speedbump. The human should feel invited to read, not rushed.
- Keep the list to 3-5 items max. Compress aggressively — file paths + one-line summary.
- If a temporal prior exists for the current segment with >= min_observations, surface it prominently as the recommended quick-start. Show both the raw EMA value and the rounded integer.
- The one-line natural language summary highlights dimensions that differ from global default by more than 1 point.
- If a saved profile exists with "friday", "evening", "sunday", or "weekend" in the name, surface it as a secondary option alongside the temporal prior.
- After presenting the inread, WAIT for the human to respond before proceeding to the questionnaire. They might say "use prior" (load temporal prior, skip questionnaire), "load friday-evening" (load manual profile, skip questionnaire), or "ok ready" (proceed to questionnaire), or ask a question about something they read.

### Step 4: Questionnaire (if no shorthand)

Ask the user up to 4 questions. Keep it fast -- the user should be able to attune in under 30 seconds. Present all answerable questions in a single message, numbered. The user can answer with just numbers or short phrases.

**Q1 -- Session mode:**
```
1. What mode for this session?
   a) exploratory -- open-ended, creative, follow interesting threads {current indicator}
   b) focused -- clear goal, execute efficiently {current indicator}
   c) sprint -- ship it, speed over perfection {current indicator}
   d) creative -- architecture and invention mode {current indicator}
```
Mark the current mode with `[current]`.

**Q2 -- Amplify (multi-select):**
Pick the 3-4 dimensions most likely to be relevant based on recent scratchpad context. Show current values.
```
2. What to amplify? (pick any, or skip)
   a) Execution speed (currently {n})
   b) Code quality (currently {n})
   c) Spatial correctness (currently {n})
   d) Model architecture (currently {n})
```
Omit dimensions already at 4 or 5 (they are already amplified). If all are already high, say "All dimensions already amplified -- skip or name one to adjust."

**Q3 -- Ego recommendations (conditional):**
Run the recommendation logic: scan `.claude/scratchpad/ego/` for the latest entry, look for patterns suggesting new dimensions. Use the `recommend_dimensions()` logic described in `.claude/hooks/supra_reader.py`:
- Pattern: `N+ sessions deferred` suggests an `urgency` dimension
- Pattern: `BLOCKED` signals suggest an `unblocking` dimension
- Frequently mentioned terms (8+ occurrences) not covered by existing dimensions

Only show Q3 if there are recommendations. Otherwise skip it entirely.
```
3. Ego noticed patterns that suggest new dimensions. Add any?
   a) urgency -- "How aggressively to prioritize long-deferred items" (ego shows items deferred up to N sessions)
   b) {other recommendation}
   c) None
```

**Q4 -- Strategic intent:**
```
4. What's this terminal's mission? (one sentence)
   Suggestion: "{contextual suggestion from forward-look or deferred P0s}"
```

This is the overarching goal that persists across `/niche` → `/clear` → `/niche` cycles. It's stored in the supra session file as `intent`. Tactical steering (which wave to run, what agent to dispatch) happens during `/niche` via chat — that's course correction, not re-valuation.

Generate suggestions from the coordinator's latest scratchpad, forward-look, and deferred P0 items. If the user says "skip", leave the intent from prior valuation (if any) or set to empty.

**Q5 -- Focus/suppress:**
```
5. Anything to focus on or suppress this session? (or skip)
   a) Focus: "{contextual suggestion based on recent scratchpads}"
   b) Focus: "{another suggestion}"
   c) Suppress: "{contextual suggestion}"
   d) Other (tell me)
```

Generate contextual suggestions by reading the coordinator's latest scratchpad for active work items and deferred items. If there is no coordinator scratchpad, offer generic options like "Focus: specific goal" / "Suppress: cleanup tasks" / "Skip".

### Step 5: Apply Changes

Based on user answers (from questionnaire or shorthand):

1. **Mode**: Update `mode` field in states
2. **Amplified dimensions**: Set selected dimensions to 4 (HIGH). If the user explicitly provides a number, use that number instead.
3. **Non-selected dimensions**: Leave at their current values. Do NOT reset them to defaults.
4. **New dimensions from recommendations**: Add to both files:
   - `schema.yaml`: add under `dimensions:` with a reasonable `group`, `default: 3`, labels, and agent_relevance
   - supra session file: add to `dimensions:` with value 3 (or 4 if the user selected it for amplification)
5. **Intent**: Store the user's strategic intent as `intent` in the supra session file. This is what `/niche` reads to understand the terminal's mission.
6. **Focus/suppress**: Replace the lists with the user's selections. If user said "skip", leave unchanged.
7. **Metadata**: Set `last_attuned` to current ISO timestamp, `last_attuned_by` to the terminal identity (read via `coordinator_registry.read_ppid_identity()`, otherwise use "manual")
8. **Record temporal observation**: Call `supra_reader.record_temporal_observation(states)` to update the EMA prior for the current temporal segment. This fires regardless of how the values were set (shorthand, questionnaire, or `use prior`). Every valuation is an observation.

Write states to the **terminal-scoped supra valuation file** at `.claude/supra/sessions/{identity_id}.yaml` using `supra_reader.write_supra_session_states()`. The identity is the poetic name minted by the first SessionStart in this terminal (e.g., `pale-listening-dew`) and persists for the lifetime of the terminal across `/clear` cycles. If no identity is available, fall back to `supra_reader.write_session_states()`. There is no global `characteristic_states.yaml` — defaults are hardcoded neutral 3s in `supra_reader._DEFAULT_STATES`. The file format is:
```yaml
mode: {mode}
intent: "{strategic intent — what this terminal is for}"
dimensions:
  execution_speed: {n}
  exploration_vs_exploitation: {n}
  ...
focus: [{items}]
suppress: [{items}]
last_attuned: "{ISO timestamp}"
last_attuned_by: "{session id}"
```

If no session ID is available (e.g. running outside coordinator mode), fall back to writing the global file.

If adding new dimensions to `schema.yaml`, preserve the existing structure and append the new dimension under the appropriate group.

### Step 5.5: Write Valuate Scratchpad

Write (or update) `.claude/scratchpad/valuate/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. This is the cross-terminal coupling mechanism at the needs/desires level — other terminals read this during their own `/valuate` to set intent with awareness of what's already running.

Format — append an entry per terminal valuation:

```markdown
## {identity_id} — {HH:MM}

- **Intent**: "{strategic intent for this terminal}"
- **Mode**: {mode} | Key dims: {only dims that differ from default, e.g. "speed=5, tests=1"}
- **Focus**: {focus items}
- **Suppress**: {suppress items}
```

If the file already exists (another terminal valuated today), **append** your entry — don't overwrite theirs. If THIS terminal already has an entry (re-valuation), update it in place.

Keep entries compact. The reader only needs: what is this terminal doing, and what should I avoid stepping on?

### Step 5.6: Write Plan Kapstok

After the valuate scratchpad is written, scaffold a plan kapstok for the next `/niche` invocation. A kapstok (Dutch: coatrack) is a structural framework with hooks to hang work on — it crystallizes today's characteristic state into a markdown plan that `/niche` reads as Wave-0 input. See `specs/valuate_plan_kapstok.md` for the full spec.

**Skip if any of:**
- Intent is empty or null (no strategic mission to scaffold)
- The user passed `no-kapstok`, `skip-plan`, or `no-plan` shorthand in this `/valuate` invocation (silent opt-out, applies only to this call)

**Otherwise call the helper:**

```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import date as _date

sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(".claude/skills/valuate").resolve()))
from plan_kapstok import write_kapstok

today = _date.today().isoformat()
kapstok_path = write_kapstok(
    supra_session_yaml=Path(f".claude/supra/sessions/{identity_id}.yaml"),
    valuate_scratchpad=Path(f".claude/scratchpad/valuate/{today}.md"),
    plans_dir=Path(".claude/plans"),
    date=today,
)

if kapstok_path:
    print(f"📐 Kapstok written to {kapstok_path}")
    print(f"   /niche Wave-0 will read it as the primary blueprint.")
```

**Behavior:**
- Returns the written `Path` on success → print the path so the user sees what was scaffolded.
- Returns `None` if the kapstok was not written (intent empty, file already exists for today's intent-slug, or write error). Silent — do not print anything for the `None` case.
- Fails open: if the helper raises unexpectedly, /valuate continues to Step 6 (the kapstok is bonus scaffolding, not load-bearing).

**What the helper produces:**
- Multi-thread kapstok (when `explore >= 4 AND mode in {creative, exploratory}`): 3–6 candidate threads with TODO-marked content, decision rule for `/niche` W0, full mandatory sections (status table, reference frame, anti-scope, peer pointer, gist).
- Single-thread kapstok (otherwise): one wave structure with W0 audit + W1+ TODO + Final Wave skeleton.

The helper does NOT generate thread *content* — that is coordinator-direct fill-in expected before W0 surfaces the menu to the user. The helper guarantees structural format-fidelity; thread substance is the human's contribution.

**Important**: kapstok plans are *seeds*, not contracts. /niche may deviate per the existing Wave-deviation policy. Re-/valuate with the same intent skips (idempotent); re-/valuate with a different intent writes a new kapstok alongside the old one.

### Step 6: Print Summary

Show a before/after comparison. Keep it compact:

```
Attunement applied:
  Mode: exploratory -> focused
  execution_speed: 3 -> 5
  test_coverage: 3 -> 1
  Focus: (none) -> "prove hex2vec works"
  (4 dimensions unchanged)
```

Only show dimensions that changed. Group unchanged dimensions into a count.

### Step 7: Handoff to Coordinator

After attunement is applied and the summary is shown, offer to launch the coordinator:

```
Ready to work. What's the task?
  a) Follow the forward-look recommendations
  b) [contextual suggestion from focus directive, e.g. "hex2vec results review"]
  c) Tell me what you want to do
```

**If the user provides a task** (either by picking an option or typing freely), invoke `/niche` with that task as the argument. The attunement is already applied — the coordinator will pick it up via the session-start hook.

**If the user says "skip"**, "not yet", or similar — end the skill. The human may want to read more or work without coordination.

**If the morning inread (Step 3.5) surfaced a forward-look with specific wave recommendations**, option (a) should reference the forward-look file path so the coordinator can follow it as a plan: e.g., "Follow forward-look (.claude/scratchpad/coordinator/2026-03-06-forward-look.md)".

This makes `/valuate` the single entry point for all sessions: orient → tune → work.

## Behavioral Rules

- **Speed over thoroughness**: This skill should complete in one exchange (shorthand) or two exchanges (questionnaire + answers). Do not over-explain.
- **Idempotent**: Running `/valuate` multiple times is fine. Re-running with no arguments re-displays the landscape and re-asks questions.
- **Preserve unknowns**: If the supra session file has fields you do not recognize, preserve them when writing back.
- **Clamping**: All dimension values must be integers in [1, 5]. Clamp if the user says something outside this range.
- **Scratchpad**: After applying changes (Step 5), write a scratchpad entry to `.claude/scratchpad/valuate/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. This is how terminals communicate valuation decisions to each other — stigmergy at the needs/desires level.
- **Mode biases are NOT baked in**: Mode biases are applied at read-time by `supra_reader.py`. The states file stores raw values only. Do not pre-apply biases when writing.
