# CLAUDE.md (DEPRECATED)

**This file is deprecated and is no longer maintained.**

Instructions for AI agents have been moved to a unified `AGENTS.md` file to ensure consistency for all collaborators.

Please refer to the following documents for guidance:
- **`AGENTS.md`**: For core commands, testing procedures, and general development workflows for AI agents.
- **`README.md`**: For a high-level overview of the project and links to specific documentation.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: For a deep dive into the system's technical design.
- **`experiments/`**: For `README.md` files within specific experiment directories that contain detailed, context-specific instructions.

The highly detailed, experiment-specific instructions that were previously in this file are being moved to `README.md` files within their respective experiment directories (e.g., `experiments/cascadia_exploratory/README.md`).
